# ProjectMonitoringDashboard
 ProjectMonitoringDashboard is a simple web-app that helps you track and monitor GitHub repositories. It shows you information like issues, pull requests, commits, and contributors. You can also see how popular a project is by tracking stars, forks, and watchers. It's an easy way to keep an eye on your open-source projects.
